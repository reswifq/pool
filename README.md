A generic object pool implementation for Swift that works on macOS and Linux.

## üèÅ Getting Started

#### Import Pool into your project using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager):

``` swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YourProject",
    targets: [],
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/reswifq/pool.git", majorVersion: 1)
    ]
)
```

#### Create a pool of elements:

``` swift
let pool = Pool(maxElementCount: 10) { 
	return "I am a pool element"
}
```

#### Draw an element from the pool:

``` swift
let element = try pool.draw()
```

#### Do something with it:

``` swift
print(element) // "I am a pool element"
```

#### Put it back in the pool, so it can be reused:

``` swift
pool.release(element)
```

#### Optionally you can wait until it has been released:

``` swift
pool.release(element) {
	print("element has been released and it's ready to be drawn again")
}
```

## üîß Compatibility
